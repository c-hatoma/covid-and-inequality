Final project for Alex Lyford's Statistical Learning class at Middlebury College. Collaborators are Bea Lee '20.5, Chica Morrow '20, Jennifer Ko '21, Olivia Jin '20.

Our group aims to look at US county-level data on eviction and demographics (e.g. eviction filings, poverty rate, and racial distributions), as well as their relevance with Covid-19 statistics like death and case rates. Using supervised and unsupervised learning, we explore the data that we obtained from USAFacts (https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map), Eviction Lab (https://evictionlab.org/), and US Census as of 4/30/2020 (https://www.census.gov/popclock/).

Given the wide range of learning techniques we explore in our project, each model addresses a different question.

## Methods
Supervised Learning: 
1. LM (simple, long, Logit) 
2. knn 
3. Single Decision Trees, Bagging, Boosting and Random Forests 
4. LDA

Unsupervised Learning: 
1. PCA 
2. Hierarchical 
3. K-Means

Overall Analysis 
* Supervised vs Unsupervised 
* Supervised 
* Unsupervised
